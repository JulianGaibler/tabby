## Introduction

tabby is a browser extension to help you switch between tabs in a breeze.

## Setup and Configuration

Since this is an extension that uses privileged browser APIs a lot of features won't work in dev-mode.

To install dependencies, run and build tabby, you need node and npm. When you have done this, you can navigate into the directory and install the dependencies.

``` bash
cd path/to/tabby
npm install
```

You can run the extension in your browser as a website by calling `npm run dev`.

If you want to build to extension you can run `npm run dev`.
After that, the unpacked extension will be in the `dist/` directory, ready to be tested in your browser.
