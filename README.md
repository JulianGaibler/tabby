## Introduction

tabby is a browser extension to help you switch between tabs in a breeze.

## Setup and Configuration

Since this is an extension that uses privileged browser APIs a lot of features won't work in dev-mode.

``` bash
# Install dependencies
npm install
# Run dev-server
npm run dev
# Build extension
npm run build
```
